MyToken Smart Contract

Description

MyToken is a simple ERC-20-like smart contract that allows users to mint and burn tokens. The contract stores details about the token such as its name, symbol, and total supply. It also maintains a mapping of addresses to balances, enabling users to track their token holdings. The contract includes functions to mint new tokens to a specified address and to burn tokens from a specified address.
